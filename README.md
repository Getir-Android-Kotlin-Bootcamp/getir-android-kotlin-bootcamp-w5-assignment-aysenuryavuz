# Getir Android Kotlin Bootcamp Week 5 Assignment

## Project Description

This project contains examples of using coroutines in Kotlin for asynchronous programming. Each example demonstrates different coroutine usage patterns.

## Usage

The project can be opened using Android Studio or a similar IDE. The `MainActivity` class represents the main activity of the application. The code inside this class can be inspected and edited if necessary.

## Page Examples

Each page example in the code represents a different coroutine usage or scenario. Each example is identified with a page number and explanatory comment lines at the beginning of the page.

## Running the Examples

The examples in the code are commented out and not directly executable. To enable and run an example, the relevant comment lines need to be removed. You can then run the project after enabling the desired coroutine example.
